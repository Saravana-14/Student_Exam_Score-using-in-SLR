This project applies Simple Linear Regression to predict a student’s exam score based on the number of study hours. The objective is to understand how study time influences academic performance and build a predictive model for real-world educational insights.
Data represents real or sample observations of how study duration impacts marks.
Implemented Simple Linear Regression using Scikit-learn,Trained the model on study hours vs exam scores
Final trained model stored as Final_model_SLR.save for future predictions.
Shows how a single feature can effectively predict performance.
